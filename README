There are alternative payment modules that can be used instead of this module: http://www.checkout.fi/materiaalit/tekninen-materiaali/

This is a payment module for Magento ecommerce platform that uses a finnish 
payment gateway called Checkout Finland. http://www.checkout.fi

Installation

Installation is simple, just drop the magento folder to whatever directory 
has your Magento installation and all the files should go the right places. 
After copying the files to your Magento installation, activate the module 
from your Magentos admin panel like you would with anyother module.

This module has the test merchant id and merchant secret as default values 
in its configuration so you can test your Magento shop before launching.

Make sure the allow_url_fopen option is set to On in your php.ini file.
If allow_url_fopen is Off this module tries to use cURL as a failsafe
to post the payment data.
